Divide the graph into S, V − S where the number the of vertices in S and V − S differ by at most 1. Recursively find the minimum spanning tree M1 and M2 in S and V − S respectively. Let e be the minimum weight edge between S and V −S. Return M1 ∪M2 ∪{e} as the answer. Show that the above algorithm is incorrect.\n",

    "Let’s start by taking a graph.\n",

    "![graph image](graph_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tAccording to the algorithm, we need to divide the graph into two parts, S and V-S, where the number of vertices in each part differs by at most 1. Let's divide it as follows: S = {A, B, C, D}    V-S = {E, F, G}\n",
    "2.\tNow, we need to recursively find the minimum spanning trees M1 and M2 in S and V-S respectively.\n",
    " For S = {A, B, C, D}: M1 = {BC (2), CD (1), AB (3)} with a total weight of 6. \n",
    " For V-S = {E, F, G}: M2 = {EF (5), FG(7)} with a total weight of 12.\n",
    "3.\tThe next step is to find the minimum weight edge e between S and V-S. The edges connecting S and V-S are:\n",
    "    -\tBE (2)\n",
    "    -\tDG (3)\n",
    "The minimum weight edge is BE (2).\n",
    "4.\tThe algorithm would return M1 ∪ M2 ∪ {e} as the answer. So, the result would be: {BC (2), CD (1), AB (3), EF (5), BE (2), FG(7)} Total weight: 20\n",
    "5.\tHowever, this is not the actual minimum spanning tree for the graph. The correct minimum spanning tree is:{AB(3), BC(2), CD(1), DG(3), BE(2), EF(5) } Total weight: 16\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm fails because it doesn't consider all possible connections between the two subgraphs. By only choosing the minimum weight edge between S and V-S, it misses the opportunity to create a more optimal global solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the algorithm includes the edge FG (7) in the final solution, which is not part of the actual minimum spanning tree. It fails to consider that using DG (3) instead of FG (7) would result in a lower total weight.\n",
    "This example demonstrates that local optimality (finding minimum spanning trees in subgraphs and connecting them with the minimum weight edge) does not necessarily lead to global optimality for the minimum spanning tree problem.\n",
    "Therefore, the given divide-and-conquer algorithm is incorrect for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.\n",

    "Proof of Correctness:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Base case: For n = 2, the algorithm correctly schedules the single match between the two teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inductive step: Assume the algorithm works correctly for n/2 teams. We need to prove it works for n teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. The algorithm correctly schedules matches within each half (n/2 teams) by the inductive hypothesis.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. For scheduling matches between the two halves:\n",
    "      - Each team from the left half plays against each team from the right half exactly once.\n",
    "      - This is ensured by the nested loops that create n/2 days of matches, where each day has n/2 matches.\n",
    "      - The modulo operation ensures that all pairs are covered without repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. The total number of days is:\n",
    "      (n/2 - 1) + n/2 = n - 1\n",
    "      Which satisfies the requirement of n-1 days for n teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each team plays exactly once each day:\n",
    "   - Within their half (by inductive hypothesis)\n",
    "   - Against teams from the other half (by construction of the inter-half schedule)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each team plays against every other team exactly once:\n",
    "   - Against teams in their half (by inductive hypothesis)\n",
    "   - Against teams in the other half (by the inter-half schedule construction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let T(n) be the time complexity for n teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recurrence relation:\n",
    "   T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n^2)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The O(n^2) term comes from the nested loops that schedule matches between the two halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The complexity for the above recuurence relation is O(n^2) using Master's theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "4. This meets both the upper bound O(n^2) and lower bound Ω(n^2) requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the algorithm correctly schedules a round-robin tournament for n teams (where n is a power of 2) in n-1 days, with a time complexity of Θ(n^2)."

    "- If Q has an equal x-coordinate, it would have been processed before P due to the secondary sorting on y-coordinate.\n",

    "In either case, Q's y-coordinate would have updated the max_y value, causing P to not be selected as undominated. This contradicts our assumption.\n",
